This readme is for my homepage.html titled Meowy Education

This homepage will have a header, image, aside, and an article. These will all be displayed correctly when shown with the CSS page. 
With just the HTML file alone, this will output the header, the image, the article, and the categories I have made. 
The header should read Meowy Education, and the photo should be of a cat in a box. 
Everything is just for show, except for the categories. Each of the categories will take you to the corresponding page when clicked on. 
The categories are Homepage, which will not work from the Homepage, Cat Toys, About Me, and References. 
I plan on making more categories as I expand my website.
